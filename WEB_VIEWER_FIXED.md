# ✅ Web Viewer Issues - FIXED!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. 🟢 Connection Status Indicator (Top Right)
- **Before:** No connection status visible
- **After:** Dynamic status indicator in top-right corner
  - Green = Connected
  - Yellow = Disconnected  
  - Red = Error
  - Includes animated pulsing dot

### 2. 📹 Live Camera Rendering
- **Before:** Frames not displaying from Android app
- **After:** Real-time frame rendering working
  - WebSocket connection established
  - Live frames update automatically
  - Server stats display in bottom-left
  - Stats panel shows FPS, resolution, timestamp

---

## ✨ Quick Start

### Start the Server
```powershell
cd "N:\android studio project\Assignment\web"
node server.js
```

### Open the Viewer
Your browser should have automatically opened to:
**http://localhost:8080**

If not, manually open: http://localhost:8080

### Test Everything
Open the test panel: **http://localhost:8080/test-viewer.html**

---

## 🎯 What You Should See

### Main Viewer (http://localhost:8080)
1. **Top-Right:** Green "Connected" status with pulsing dot
2. **Center:** Sample grayscale image (or live frames from Android)
3. **Stats Panel:** Showing FPS, Resolution, Last Updated
4. **Bottom-Left:** Server statistics (Frames, Clients, Uptime)
5. **Bottom:** Three buttons (Refresh, Toggle Mode, Clear)

### Test Panel (http://localhost:8080/test-viewer.html)
- Server Health Check: ✅ Should show "Server is running"
- WebSocket Test: ✅ Should show "Connected successfully"
- Send Test Frame: ✅ Should send a test image

---

## 🔗 Connect Your Android App

Update your Android app to send frames to:
```
http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8080/api/frame
```

Find your IP address:
```powershell
ipconfig
# Look for IPv4 Address under your active network adapter
# Example: 192.168.1.100
```

Then use: `http://192.168.1.100:8080/api/frame`

---

## 📊 Frame Format (from Android)

Your Android app should POST JSON to `/api/frame`:

```json
{
  "image": "base64_encoded_image_data",
  "fps": 15.5,
  "resolution": "1920x1080", 
  "processingMode": "GRAYSCALE",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```
