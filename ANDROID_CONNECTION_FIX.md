# Android App - Web Server Connection Fixed! ✅

## Problem Solved
The Android app was showing **"Web server not available. Running locally only"** because it was trying to connect to an incorrect IP address and port.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Auto-Discovery Feature** 🔍
- The app now automatically tries multiple server URLs
- It searches through common IP address patterns
- Connects to the first available server
- Remembers the working URL for future use

### 2. **Updated IP Configuration** 🌐
- Your computer's IP: **192.168.86.130**
- Server is running on port: **8080**
- The app is now configured with your actual IP

### 3. **Better Error Handling** 💪
- Graceful fallback when server is unavailable
- Helpful error messages with setup instructions
- App continues to work locally even without web server
- Non-blocking connection attempts

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `WebServerClient.kt`
**Changes:**
- Updated `WebServerConfig` with your computer's IP: `192.168.86.130:8080`
- Added auto-discovery functionality
- Added multiple fallback IP addresses
- Improved connection timeout handling

### 2. `MainActivity.kt`
**Changes:**
- Implemented `tryConnectToWebServer()` method
- Added automatic server discovery on app startup
- Better error messages with helpful instructions
- Non-blocking connection attempts

---

## How It Works Now

### On App Startup:
1. ✅ App initializes camera and UI
2. 🔍 Automatically tries to find web server
3. 📡 Tests these URLs in order:
   - `http://192.168.86.130:8080` ← **Your computer**
   - `http://192.168.1.100:8080`
   - `http://192.168.0.100:8080`
   - `http://10.0.0.100:8080`
   - `http://10.0.2.2:8080` ← For emulator

4. ✓ Connects to first available server
5. 💾 Remembers the working URL
6. 📸 Starts streaming camera frames

### If Server Not Found:
- App shows helpful message with setup instructions
- App continues to run locally
- Camera and processing work normally
- No crashes or errors

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Make Sure Web Server is Running
```powershell
# In PowerShell (from web directory):
cd "N:\android studio project\Assignment\web"
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
============================================================
CV Processing Server Started
============================================================
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:8080
```

### Step 2: Check Your Computer's IP
```powershell
ipconfig | Select-String "IPv4"
```

Expected output:
```
IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.86.130
```

✅ **The code is already configured with this IP!**

### Step 3: Ensure Both Devices Are on Same Network
- Computer must be connected to Wi-Fi
- Android device must be connected to the **same** Wi-Fi network
- (Not mobile data!)

### Step 4: Allow Firewall Access
When you first start the server, Windows may ask:
- "Allow Node.js to access the network?"
- **Click "Allow"** for Private networks

### Step 5: Build and Run Android App
```bash
# From Android Studio:
1. File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files
2. Build -> Clean Project
3. Build -> Rebuild Project
4. Run -> Run 'app'
```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Successful Connection:
You'll see a Toast message:
```
✓ Web server connected: http://192.168.86.130:8080
```

In Logcat:
```
I/MainActivity: Attempting to discover web server...
D/MainActivity: Trying server at: http://192.168.86.130:8080 (attempt 1/5)
D/WebServerClient: Server health check successful: {"success":true,...}
I/MainActivity: ✓ Web server connected: http://192.168.86.130:8080
```

### ❌ No Server Found:
You'll see a Toast message:
```
Web server not available. Running locally only.

To connect:
1. Start web server: node server.js
2. Find your computer's IP: ipconfig
3. Update server URL in code
```

In Logcat:
```
I/MainActivity: Attempting to discover web server...
D/MainActivity: Trying server at: http://192.168.86.130:8080 (attempt 1/5)
E/WebServerClient: Server health check failed
D/MainActivity: Trying server at: http://192.168.1.100:8080 (attempt 2/5)
...
W/MainActivity: Web server not found after trying 5 URLs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Shows "Not Available"

**Solution 1: Verify Server is Running**
```powershell
# Check if Node.js is running:
Get-Process -Name "node"

# Test server manually:
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

**Solution 2: Check IP Address**
Your IP might have changed. Get current IP:
```powershell
ipconfig | Select-String "IPv4"
```

If different from `192.168.86.130`, update line 227 in `WebServerClient.kt`:
```kotlin
"http://YOUR_NEW_IP:8080",  // Update this line
```

**Solution 3: Firewall Check**
```powershell
# Temporarily disable firewall to test:
# Windows Security -> Firewall -> Turn off (Private networks only)
# Test app, then turn firewall back on
```

**Solution 4: Test Connection from Phone Browser**
On your Android device:
1. Open Chrome browser
2. Navigate to: `http://192.168.86.130:8080`
3. You should see the web viewer
4. If not, there's a network issue

### Issue: Connection Works Initially, Then Fails

**Solution: Check Network Stability**
- Make sure both devices stay on Wi-Fi
- Router might have assigned a new IP
- Restart server and app

### Issue: App Crashes on Startup

**Solution: Check Permissions**
Make sure `AndroidManifest.xml` has:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

## Advanced: Manual IP Configuration

If auto-discovery isn't working, you can force a specific IP:

1. Open `WebServerClient.kt`
2. Find line 227 (in `commonServerUrls`)
3. Put your IP at the top of the list:
```kotlin
private val commonServerUrls = listOf(
    "http://YOUR_IP_HERE:8080",  // Try this first
    "http://192.168.86.130:8080",
    // ... rest of list
)
```
