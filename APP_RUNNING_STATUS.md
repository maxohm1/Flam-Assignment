## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If frames stop appearing:
1. Check phone screen isn't locked
2. Check app is still running
3. Check Wi-Fi connection
4. Restart app: `adb shell am force-stop max.ohm.assignment && adb shell am start -n max.ohm.assignment/.MainActivity`

### If FPS is too low:
- Expected for edge detection (~5-10 FPS)
- Switch to GRAYSCALE or RAW for higher FPS
- Good lighting improves performance

### To restart everything:
```powershell
# Stop app
adb shell am force-stop max.ohm.assignment

# Restart app
adb shell am start -n max.ohm.assignment/.MainActivity

# Refresh web viewer
# Press F5 in browser
```
